This site was built to demonstrate simple Siantra routing and use of basic ERB tepmplates. It makes use of a wonderful Ruby gem called [Faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) that automagically populates projects with placeholder content.

## Tech used:
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Sass
- Gulp for build tasks

In addition to learning ERB templates, this project was one of the first opportunities I've had to teach myself Ruby-based application deployment using Unicorn and Nginx.
